# Exercise: Data Flow Map 1

During this course we encourage our learners to work on their own research data management strategy and reflect on different themes based on the data they expect to collect/produce.

We encourage the self-learners following the course through this Jupyter book to take the time and do this reflection exercise. You can maybe ask one of your team members to provide feedback on your data flow map.

After finishing Module 1 and Module 2, you should reflect on the type of research data/software you are collecting/producing, provide a description of them and to create your own back-up and storage strategy for the data of your project applying what you have learned.

Find here below a template and a step-by-step guide to help you structure the different aspects of the data flow map.

**Note: This exercise is only a reflective practice, you do not need to submit it nor will you receive feedback on it.**
