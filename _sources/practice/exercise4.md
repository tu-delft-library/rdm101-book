# 🏋️ Exercise: Data Flow Map Part 2
In Module 3 you have learned about the main elements of the FAIR principles (i.e. Documentation & Metadata, Interoperability, Access to Data, Persistent Identifiers and Licences). In Module 4 we have explored some best practices for data organisation and we suggested you to explore some documentation tools that can make documentation easier. In Module 4, you also learned about data publication in data repositories.

We suggest that you take again a moment to reflect on your own research project and create a strategy on how you will apply what you have learned so far.

Please read the step-by-step instructions before working on the exercise. Here we provide again a template in case you want to use it for structuring your map.
